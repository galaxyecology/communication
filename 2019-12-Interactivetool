After the amazing 2016 [Galaxy Interactive Environment](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/interactive_environments.html) functionality creation, an evolution of such terrific functionality is now in production: Interactive Tools introduced by Dan Blankenberg in [GCC2019](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/PSfj/realtimetools-integrating-customizing-and-accessing-ui-based-tools-in-galaxy) !

## Official launch of the Interactive Tools functonality on usegalaxy.eu

### A first openness of the door

In october wonder Galaxy Europe team launched live.usegalaxy.eu, a Galaxy Europe subdomain dedicated to the launch of interactive tools.

### What are interactive tools ?

TO-DO

#### First try on R Shiny app

Interactivity is a major component of Ecology data analysis, and more and more something asked by others life scientists! For sure, having possibilities to deploy Jupyter notebook on demand, or Rstudio server is a huge functionality. One particular interest for ecology communities is related to the deployment of R Shiny apps. 

A first usegalaxy.eu try was made around the [Wallace R Shiny app](https://wallaceecomod.github.io/), "a flexible platform for reproducible modeling of species niches and distributions" and thanks to, again, the amazing Galaxy Europe team, [Wallace R Shiny app interactive tool](https://ecology.usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=interactive_tool_wallace) is ready to use since october and an associated [Galaxy training material](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/ecology/tutorials/species-distribution-modeling/tutorial.html) to try it.
